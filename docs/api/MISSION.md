<br>

**Responses:**

- `200 OK`: search done successfully (could retrieve no missions). Example with pagination.

    "users": ["<missions>"],
    "pagination": {
      "currentPage": "<currentPage>",
      "totalPages": "<totalPages>",
      "totalItems": "<totalItems>",
      "hasMore": "<hasMore>"
    }
  }
  ```

    }
  }
  ```
  <br>

**Workflow:** application missions are searched by their title, with pagination used by default, although it is optional. The database search is performed using the PostgreSQL `unaccent` extension, which removes accents and diacritics from a text string, transforming them into their base equivalent, so that text strings are compared in a way that is insensitive to accents.
